# Advent of Code 2020

Trying to improve my Python skills by taking on the Advent of Code (https://adventofcode.com/2020)

Run code by specifying the AOC day and part to be solved, e.g., to solve Day 1, Part 2:

`python aoc-2020-python 1 2`

 * Day 1: "Report Repair" - iteration, arithmetic calculation and exhaustive search (aoc2020_day1.py)
 * Day 2: "Password Philosophy" - iteration, string parsing and searching (aoc2020_day2.py)
